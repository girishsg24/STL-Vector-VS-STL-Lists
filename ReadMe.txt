Compare the performances of the Standard Template Library (STL) vector and 
the STL linked list.

A test program causes the vector and the linked list to undergo an identical set of operations, 
and it will time how long it takes each data structure to perform the operations. 
The program prints a table that compares the timings for vectors and lists of various sizes: 
100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000 and 100000.
